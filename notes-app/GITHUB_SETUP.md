# GitHub Setup & Submission Guide

## üéØ Quick GitHub Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New" repository button
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `notes-application`
   - **Description**: `Full-stack notes app with authentication and role-based access`
   - **Visibility**: Public (so interviewer can access)
   - **Initialize**: Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd notes-app

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete notes application with auth and RBAC"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/notes-application.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Check that all files are there:
   - backend/
   - frontend/
   - README.md
   - DEPLOYMENT.md
   - etc.

## üöÄ Deploy to Get Live URL

### Quick Deploy with Vercel & Render

1. **Deploy Frontend (2 minutes):**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Set Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Add env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = (wait for backend URL)
   - Deploy

2. **Deploy Backend (3 minutes):**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Create Web Service from GitHub
   - Set Root Directory: `backend`
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Add PostgreSQL database
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

3. **Update Frontend:**
   - Go back to Vercel

# Make sure you didn't commit node_modules or venv
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git rm -r --cached venv
git commit -m "Remove unnecessary files"

### Issue: .env files in repository
```bash
# Remove them immediately (they contain secrets!)
git rm --cached backend/.env
git rm --cached frontend/.env.local
git commit -m "Remove env files"
```
